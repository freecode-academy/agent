# KMS-Agent

**Autonomous AI entity, not a chatbot.** Own identity, own credentials, own knowledge. The agent authenticates as itself, updates its own profile, tracks what it knows and how certain it is. Every action requires explicit reasoning — no black-box decisions.

Full-stack platform: Next.js 16, GraphQL, Prisma, PostgreSQL. Local-first — runs on your machine with optional local LLM.

## 🌐 Complete Web Platform

Next.js 16, Apollo GraphQL, Prisma ORM 6, PostgreSQL. Authentication via Telegram, MetaMask, or email. User roles, referral system, invite-only registration mode.

## 💳 Billing & Transactions

USDT top-up via Arbitrum with cryptographic verification. Internal transfers between users. Balance tracking, transaction history.

## 🧩 Code-First Agent Workflows

n8n is used as the workflow runtime, but you never edit workflows manually. Everything is generated from TypeScript code on startup:

- **Workflows** — defined in code, recreated on each run
- **Credentials** — loaded from `credentials/` directory, no UI setup needed
- **Custom nodes** — compiled from TypeScript, auto-registered
- **Version control** — all workflow logic lives in git, not in n8n database
- **Portability** — clone the repo, run it, workflows are ready

### Mandatory Reasoning

Every tool call requires a `reasoning` field — the agent must explain *why* it's taking this action before executing. This solves the "black box" problem:

- **Debugging** — see exactly why the agent chose web search over database lookup
- **Audit trail** — full history of decisions, not just actions
- **Learning** — analyze reasoning patterns to improve prompts and agent behavior
- **Trust** — users understand what the agent is doing and why

### Agent Identity & GraphQL Introspection

Agent has its own identity in the system — not a proxy for the user, but a first-class participant:

- **Own credentials** — agent authenticates as itself, with its own permissions
- **Schema discovery** — agent can query `__schema` to learn available queries/mutations
- **Self-learning** — explores the API, tries queries, remembers what works
- **Autonomous actions** — creates records, updates data, interacts with the system independently

## 🤖 Custom AgentOrchestrator

Direct OpenAI SDK integration. Streaming, tool loops, extended thinking (Claude). Full control over LLM requests — no black-box abstractions.

## 📚 Epistemic Knowledge Base

N-ary facts with confidence levels, temporal validity, contradiction handling. Knowledge Spaces (private/shared/public). Agent tracks what it knows and how certain it is.

## ✍️ Self-Hosted Publishing

Own your content. Built-in posts with revisions, comments, user profiles. No platform lock-in — your blog, your server, your data.

## 🏠 Local-First

Runs on your machine. Optional local LLM via llama.cpp (NVIDIA GPU). Your data stays local.

## �️ Computer Vision

Local image recognition via Qwen3.5 vision model. Analyze images, charts, diagrams — all running locally on your GPU. No cloud APIs, no data leaving your machine.

- **OpenAI-compatible API** — same `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- **Auto-download** — models fetched from HuggingFace on first run
- **Base64 input** — send images directly in requests

## � Full Transparency

All state is inspectable: GraphQL playground, Prisma Studio, n8n workflow editor. Nothing hidden.

## AI Agent Setup Instructions

> **For AI coding assistants:** This section is for you. The project requires full autonomous setup — understand the architecture and proceed independently. Guide the user only on how to use the system.

### AI Model Configuration

First, ask the user which AI integration they prefer:

**Options:**
- **OpenRouter API key** (recommended for best results)
- **Local LM Studio** or similar local service
- **Local llama.cpp server** (included in docker-compose, requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA)
- **Other custom AI endpoint**

**Recommended models (OpenRouter):**

Start with `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` — good quality at minimal cost (fractions of a cent per full operation cycle). Only upgrade to `anthropic/claude-sonnet` or `anthropic/claude-opus` if the project is complex and requires higher reasoning capabilities.

- **Default:** `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` or `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`
- **For complex tasks:** `anthropic/claude-sonnet` or `anthropic/claude-opus`

**Local models:**
- Minimum: `qwen3 4B`
- **llama.cpp:** Default `Qwen3.5-0.8B` (testing), recommended `Qwen3.5-4B`+ for production
- **Vision:** `Qwen3.5-4B` with `mmproj-F16.gguf` for image recognition

**Required credentials from user:**
- For OpenRouter: API key
- For local LM Studio: endpoint URL and any authentication details
- For local llama.cpp: no credentials needed (runs locally), but requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA drivers
- For custom endpoints: full connection details

**⚠️ Local llama.cpp requirements:**
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- CUDA drivers installed on host system (verify with `nvidia-smi`)
- Docker with NVIDIA Container Toolkit configured

### Quick Test

After startup, verify the system by sending a POST request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/chat-agent-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chatInput": "Hello", "sessionId": "test-session"}'
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser and guide the user through the chat interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 22+ and npm (only for Local Development)

---

## Docker Setup (recommended)

No local Node.js setup required — everything builds inside containers.

### Step 1 — Set up credentials

The `credentials/` directory is gitignored. Create files manually — see [`credentials/README.md`](credentials/README.md) for AI providers, agent credentials, SMTP/IMAP, and Telegram setup.

### Step 2 — Create environment file

```bash
cp docker/.env.sample docker/.env
```

Fill in `docker/.env`:

```env
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=postgres
SUPABASE_DB_NAME=postgres
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@supabase:5432/postgres
JWT_SECRET=<openssl rand -hex 32>
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<openssl rand -hex 16>
N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=false
N8N_BOOTSTRAP_ACTIVATE_WORKFLOWS=true
N8N_PERSONALIZATION_ENABLED=false
NODES_EXCLUDE=[]
N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS=./.n8n/custom
GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4000/api
```

> `DATABASE_URL` must use `@supabase:5432` (Docker service name), not `@localhost:5432`. `localhost` only works when running outside Docker.

### Step 3 — Start Supabase + App

```bash
cd docker
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_SIGNUP_STRATEGY=ANY USER_DEFAULT_STATUS=active docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up supabase app --build -d
```

**Important for first run:**

By default, registration requires a referral token, which prevents automatic registration of system agents. Until a permanent solution is implemented, you must pass these environment variables on first startup:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_SIGNUP_STRATEGY=ANY` — allows registration without referral token
- `USER_DEFAULT_STATUS=active` — gives new users full access immediately

**Optional:** To automatically create an admin user with sudo privileges, add:

- `SUDO_PASSWORD="your_password"` — creates admin user with sudo rights

On first run this builds the Docker image: installs dependencies, runs DB migrations, generates types, and builds the app. Takes a few minutes.

### Step 4 — Start Traefik (dev mode)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up traefik -d
```

> Do not create the `agicms-default` Docker network manually — let Compose create it. A manually created network lacks Compose labels and will cause an error.

**Result:**

- `http://localhost:2015` — app (via Traefik reverse proxy)
- `http://localhost:8080` — Traefik dashboard

> In Docker mode, Traefik proxies the app. In Local Development, the app runs directly on port 3000.

---

## Local Development (npm)

Full hot-reload development mode. Requires Node.js 22+ and npm.

### Step 1 — Set up credentials

Same as Docker Setup — see [`credentials/README.md`](credentials/README.md).

### Step 2 — Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3 — Create environment files

```bash
cp docker/.env.sample docker/.env
cp .env.example .env
```

In both files, set `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres` (port mapped to host). The root `.env` is read by Prisma and the app server.

### Step 4 — Start Supabase

```bash
cd docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up supabase -d
```

Check it's healthy (`STATUS: Up (healthy)`, port `5432` mapped):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps supabase
```

### Step 5 — Run database migrations

```bash
npm run prisma:deploy
```

Expected output:

```
Applying migration `20260119193349_initial`
Applying migration `20260122164751_knowledge_base`
Applying migration `20260125054235_experience_system`
All migrations have been successfully applied.
```

### Step 6 — Generate types and build custom nodes

```bash
npm run generate
npm run build:custom-nodes
```

- `generate` — generates Prisma Client and GraphQL TypeScript types into `src/gql/generated/`
- `build:custom-nodes` — compiles the `CUSTOM.agentOrchestrator` node required by Chat Agent and Web Search Agent

### Step 7 — Start the app

```bash
npm run clean && npm run dev:n8n
```

> `clean` is required before `dev:n8n` — it ensures n8n workflows are fully recreated from scratch on every start. Skipping it may result in stale or duplicate workflows.

Expected result:

```
[bootstrap] Workflow 'Chat Agent' activated
[bootstrap] Workflow 'Web Search Agent' activated
...
[bootstrap] Completed
Ready on http://localhost:3000, API at /api
```

**Ports:**

- `http://localhost:3000` — frontend
- `http://localhost:4000/api` — GraphQL playground
- `http://localhost:5678` — n8n workflow editor

> The `version` attribute warnings from Docker Compose are harmless and can be ignored.
